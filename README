Summary
-------

Add the 'pyramid' command to cubicweb-ctl".

This cube also add a ``CWSession`` entity type so that sessions can be
stored in the database, which allows to run a Cubicweb instance
without having to set up a session storage (like redis or memcache)
solution.

However, for production systems, it is greatly advised to use such a
storage solution for the sessions.

The handling of the sessions is made by pyramid (see the
`pyramid's documentation on sessions`_ for more details).

For example, to set up a redis based session storage, you need the
`pyramid-redis-session`_ package, then you must configure pyramid to
use this backend, by configuring the ``pyramid.ini`` file in the instance's
config directory (near the ``all-in-one.conf`` file):


.. code-block:: ini

   [main]
   cubicweb.defaults = no # we do not want to load the default cw session handling

   cubicweb.auth.authtkt.session.secret = <secret1>
   cubicweb.auth.authtkt.persistent.secret = <secret2>
   cubicweb.auth.authtkt.session.secure = yes
   cubicweb.auth.authtkt.persistent.secure = yes

   redis.sessions.secret = <secret3>
   redis.sessions.prefix = <my-app>:

   redis.sessions.url = redis://localhost:6379/0

   pyramid.includes =
           pyramid_redis_sessions
           pyramid_cubicweb.auth
           pyramid_cubicweb.login


See the documentation of `Pyramid Cubicweb`_ for more details.


Secrets
~~~~~~~

There are a number of secrets to configure in ``pyramid.ini``. They
should be different one from each other, as explained in `Pyramid's
documentation`_.

For the record:

:cubicweb.session.secret: This secret is used to encrypt the session's
   data ID (data themselved are stored in the backend, database or
   redis) when using the integrated (``CWSession`` based) session data
   storage.

:redis.session.secret: This secret is used to encrypt the session's
   data ID (data themselved are stored in the backend, database or
   redis) when using redis as backend.

:cubicweb.auth.authtkt.session.secret: This secret is used to encrypt
   the authentication cookie.

:cubicweb.auth.authtkt.persistent.secret: This secret is used to
   encrypt the persistent authentication cookie.
