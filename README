Patches should be submitted by email at the cubicweb-devel@lists.cubicweb.org
mailing list in order to get reviewed by project integrators or any community
member.
The simplest way of send patches is to use the ``hg email`` command available
through the *patchbomb* extension of Mercurial. Preferably, patches should be
*in the message body* of emails. When submitting a revised version of a patch
series, a prefix indicating the iteration number ``<n>`` of the series should
be added to email subject prefixes; this can be achieved by specifying a
``--flag v<n>`` option to ``hg email`` command. If needed you can also use the
--in-reply-to option.

Examples:

    hg email --to cubicweb-devel@lists.cubicweb.org --intro -r <start>::<end>
    hg email --flag V2 --to cubicweb-devel@lists.cubicweb.org -r <start>::<end>

If you have any questions you can also come on Logilab's public XMPP room using
a XMPP client: public@conference.jabber.logilab.org
