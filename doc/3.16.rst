What's new in CubicWeb 3.16?
============================

New functionnalities
--------------------

* Add a new dataimport store (`SQLGenObjectStore`). This store enables a fast
  import of data (entity creation, link creation) in CubicWeb, by directly
  flushing information in SQL.  This may only be used with PostgreSQL, as it
  requires the 'COPY FROM' command.


API changes
-----------

* db-api/configuration: all the external repository connection information is
  now in an URL (see #2521848), allowing to drop specific options of pyro ns
  host, group, etc and fix broken ZMQ source. Configuration related changes:

  * Dropped 'pyro-ns-host', 'pyro-instance-id', 'pyro-ns-group' from client side
    config, in favor of 'repository-uri'. **NO MIGRATION DONE**, supposing there
    is no web-only config in the wild.

  * Stop discovering the connection method through `repo_method` class attribute
    of the configuration, varying according to the configuration class. This is
    a first step on the way to a simpler configuration handling.

  DB-API related changes:

  * Stop indicating the connection method using `ConnectionProperties`.

  * Drop `_cnxtype` attribute from `Connection` and `cnxtype` from
    `Session`. The former is replaced by a is_repo_in_memory property
    and the later is totaly useless.

  * Turn `repo_connect` into `_repo_connect` to mark it as private function.

  * Deprecate `in_memory_cnx` which becomes useless, use `_repo_connect` instead
    if necessary.

* the "tcp://" uri scheme used for ZMQ communications (in a way
  reminiscent of Pyro) is now named "zmqpickle-tcp://", so as to make
  room for future zmq-based lightweight communications (without python
  objects pickling).


Unintrusive API changes
-----------------------

* Drop of `cubicweb.web.uicfg.AutoformSectionRelationTags.bw_tag_map`,
  deprecated since 3,6.

User interface changes
----------------------

* Remove changelog view, as nor cubicweb nor known cubes/applications were properly
  feeding related files
