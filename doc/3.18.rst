============================

New functionalities
--------------------

* add a security debugging tool
  (see `#2920304 <http://www.cubicweb.org/2920304>`_)


API changes
-----------

* not really an API change, but the entity permission checks are now
  systematically deferred to an operation, instead of a) trying in a
  hook and b) if it failed, retrying later in an operation

  import it in your cubes (even to unregister it)
  (see `#3093362 <http://www.cubicweb.org/3093362>`_)
