What's new in CubicWeb 3.18?
============================

New functionalities
--------------------

* add a security debugging tool
  (see `#2920304 <http://www.cubicweb.org/2920304>`_)


API changes
-----------

* not really an API change, but the entity permission checks are now
  systematically deferred to an operation, instead of a) trying in a
  hook and b) if it failed, retrying later in an operation

* The default value storage for attributes is no longer String, but
  Bytes.  This opens the road to storing arbitrary python objects, e.g.
  numpy arrays, and fixes a bug where default values whose truth value
  was False were not properly migrated.

Deprecation
---------------------



Deprecated Code Drops
----------------------

* ``ldapuser`` have been dropped; use ``ldapfeed`` now
  (see `#2936496 <http://www.cubicweb.org/2936496>`_)

* action ``GotRhythm`` was removed, make sure you do not
  import it in your cubes (even to unregister it)
  (see `#3093362 <http://www.cubicweb.org/3093362>`_)

* all 3.8 backward compat is gone

* all 3.9 backward compat (including the javascript side) is gone
