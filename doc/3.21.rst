What's new in CubicWeb 3.21?
============================

Code movement
-------------

The cubicweb.web.views.timeline module (providing the timeline-json, timeline
and static-timeline views) has moved to a standalone cube_

.. _cube: https://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-timeline

Deprecated code drops
---------------------

* the user_callback api has been removed; people should use plain
  ajax functions instead

* the Pyro remote repository access method has been entirely removed
  (emerging alternatives such as rqlcontroller and cwclientlib should
  be used instead)
