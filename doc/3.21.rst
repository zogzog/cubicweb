What's new in CubicWeb 3.21?
============================

Code movement
-------------

The cubicweb.web.views.timeline module (providing the timeline-json, timeline
and static-timeline views) has moved to a standalone cube_

.. _cube: https://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-timeline

Deprecated code drops
---------------------

* the user_callback api has been removed; people should use plain
  ajax functions instead

* the `Pyro` and `Zmq-pickle` remote repository access methods have
  been entirely removed (emerging alternatives such as rqlcontroller
  and cwclientlib should be used instead).  Note that as a side effect,
  "repository-only" instances (i.e. without a http component) are no
  longer possible.  If you have any such instances, you will need to
  rename the configuration file from repository.conf to all-in-one.conf
  and run ``cubicweb-ctl upgrade`` to update it.
