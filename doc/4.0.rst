What's new in CubicWeb 4.0?
============================

Behavior Changes
----------------

* The anonymous property of Session and Connection are now computed from the
  related user login. If it match the ``anonymous-user`` in the config the
  connection is anonymous. Beware that the ``anonymous-user`` config is web
  specific. Therefore, no session may be anonymous in repository only setup.

API changes
-----------

* ``RepositorySessionManager.postlogin`` is now called with two arguments,
  request and session. And this now happens before the session is linked to the
  request.

* ``SessionManager`` and ``AuthenticationManager`` now take a repo object at
  initialization time instead of a vreg.

* The ``async`` argument of ``_cw.call_service`` have been dropped. All call are
  now  synchronous. The zmq notification bus looks like a good replacement for
  most async usecase.

* ``repo.stats()`` is now deprecated. The same information are available through
  a service (``_cw.call_service('repo_stats')``)

* ``repo.gc_stats()`` is now deprecated. The same information are available through
  a service (``_cw.call_service('repo_gc_stats')``)

* ``request.set_session`` no longer takes an optional ``user`` argument.

* CubicwebTC does not have repo and cnx as class attributes anymore. They are
  standard instance attributes. ``set_cnx`` and ``_init_repo`` class methods
  become instance methods.


Deprecated Code Drops
----------------------

* The ldapuser source has been dropped. ldapfeed is the only official source
  remaining for ldap.

* session.hijack_user mechanism has been dropped.
