What's new in CubicWeb 4.0?
============================

API changes
-----------

* ``RepositorySessionManager.postlogin`` is now called with two arguments,
  request and session. And this now happens before the session is linked to the
  request.

* ``SessionManager`` and ``AuthenticationManager`` now take a repo object at
  initialization time instead of a vreg.


Deprecated Code Drops
----------------------

* The ldapuser source has been dropped. ldapfeed is the only official source
  remaining for ldap.

* session.hijack_user mechanism has been dropped.
