Quick overview of `CubicWeb`
============================

`CubicWeb` allows us to develop web applications instances based on
one or more `cubes`.

What we call a `cube` is a model defining the data types and views. 
A `cube` is a reusable component grouped with others cubes in the file
system.

An `instance` refers to a specific installation of one or more `cubes`
 where are grouped configuration files of the final web application.

In this document, we will show you how to create a `cube` and how to use it
in an `instance` for your web application.
