Pre-defined schemas in the library
----------------------------------

The library defines a set of entities schemas that are required by the system
or commonly used in `LAX` applications.
Of course, you can extend those schemas if necessarry.

System schemas
``````````````
Those are defined in::

  ./myapp/ginco/schemas/
  ./myapp/ginco/entities/

``schemas/`` defines the data model you will use in your application. 
It allows you to describre the entities and the relations you will need.

``entities/`` deifnes the methods you might need on the entities you 
defined in your schema.

The system entities available are :

* `EUser`, system users
* `EGroup`, users groups
* `EEType`, entity type
* `ERType`, relation type

* `State`, workflow state
* `Transition`, workflow transition
* `TrInfo`, record of a transition trafic for an entity 

* `EmailAddress`, email address, used by the system to send notifications
  to the users and also used by others optionnals schemas

* `EProperty`, used to configure the application
* `EPermission`, used to configure the security of the application

* `Card`, generic documenting card
* `Bookmark`, an entity type used to allow a user to customize his links within
  the application


Components in the library
`````````````````````````

Those are defined in::

  ./myapp/ginco-apps/

An application is based on several basic components. In the set of available
basic components we can find by example :

* `ecomment`, provides an entity type for `Comment` allowing us to comment others
  site's entities

* `emailinglist`, provides an entity type for `Mailinglist` which groups informations
  in a discussion list

* `efile`, provides entity types for `File` et `Image` used to represent
  files (text or binary) with additionnal informations such as MIME type or
  encoding.
  
* `elink`, provides an entity type for hypertext link (`Link`)

* `eblog`, provides an entity type weblog (`Blog`)

* `eperson`, provides an entity type for a person (`Person`)

* `eaddressbook`, provides an entity type used to represent phone 
  numbers (`PhoneNumber`) and mailing address (`PostalAddress`)
  
* `eclasstags`, categorization system based on tags (`Tag`)

* `eclassfolders`, categorization system based on folders hierarchy in order 
  to create navigation sections (`Folder`)

* `eemail`, archiving management for emails (`Email`, `Emailpart`,
  `Emailthread`)

* `ebasket`, basket management (`Basket`) allowing to group entities

To declare the use of a component, once installed, add the name of the component
to the variable `__use__` in the file `__pkginfo__.py` of your own component.
