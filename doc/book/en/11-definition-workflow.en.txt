Defining a Workflow
===================

General
-------

A workflow can be defined in a `LAX` application thanks to the system 
entities ``State`` and ``Transition``. Those are defined within all 
LAX application and can be set-up through the main administrator interface.

Once your schema is defined, you can start creating the set of states and
the required transitions for your applications entities.

You first need to define the states and then the transitions between those
to complete your workflow.

A ``State`` defines the status of an entity. While creating a new state, 
you will be first given the option to select the entity type the state
can be applied to. By choosing ``Apply``, a new section will be displayed
in the editing screen to enable you to add relation to the state you are
creating.

A ``Transition`` is also based on an entity type it can be applied to.
By choosing ``Apply``, a new section will be displayed in the editing 
screen to enable you to add relation to the transition you are
creating.

At the transition level you will also define the group of user which can
aplly this transition to an object.
