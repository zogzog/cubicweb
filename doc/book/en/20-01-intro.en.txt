Introduction
============

What is  `Google AppEngine` ?
------------------------------

`Google AppEngine`_ is provided with a partial port of the `Django`
framework, but Google stated at Google IO 2008 that it would not
support a specific Python web framework and that all
community-supported frameworks would be more than welcome [1]_. 

Therefore `Logilab`_ ported `CubicWeb` to run on top of `Google AppEngine`'s
datastore.

Essentials
----------

To build a web application for `Google App Engine`'s datastore, you
need to have a good understanding of the main concepts of our 
`CubicWeb` framework.

The main concepts are:

  - *schema*

  - *query language*

  - *result set*

  - *views*

  - *generated user interface*

  - *cube*

You can find detailled explanation of those concepts in :ref:`TermsVocabulary`.
