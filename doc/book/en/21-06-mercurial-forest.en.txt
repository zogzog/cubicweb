We also provide in this book a quick guide on how to use
Mercurial (:ref:`MercurialPresentation`).


Installation of the forest extension
````````````````````````````````````

Set up the forest extension by getting a copy of the sources 
from http://hg.akoha.org/hgforest/ and adding the following 
lines to your ``~/.hgrc``: ::

   [extensions]
   hgext.forest=
   # or, if forest.py is not in the hgext dir:
   # forest=/path/to/forest.py

Get `CubicWeb` source code
``````````````````````````

Clone the forest in you working directory.

::

  hg fclone http://www.logilab.org/hg/forests/cubicweb

.. note:: 
  We recommand you to create a symbolic link to the command ``cubicweb-ctl``
  as you will use it pretty often.

  ::
    
    $ ln -s /path/to/forest/cubicweb/bin/cubicweb-ctl ~/bin
