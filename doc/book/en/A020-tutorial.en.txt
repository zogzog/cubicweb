Quick overview of `CubicWeb`
============================

`CubicWeb` is a semantic web application framework that favors reuse and
object-oriented design.

A `cube` is a component that includes a model defining the data types and a set of
views to display the data. 

An application is a `cube`, but usually an application is built by assembling
a few smaller cubes.

An `instance` is a specific installation of an application and includes
configuration files.

This tutorial will show how to create a `cube` and how to use it as an
application to run an `instance`.
