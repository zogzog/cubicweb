Pre-defined schemas in the library
----------------------------------

The library defines a set of entities schemas that are required by the system
or commonly used in `CubicWeb` applications.
Of course, you can extend those schemas if necessary.


System schemas
``````````````
The system entities available are :

* `EUser`, system users
* `EGroup`, users groups
* `EEType`, entity type
* `ERType`, relation type

* `State`, workflow state
* `Transition`, workflow transition
* `TrInfo`, record of a transition trafic for an entity 

* `EmailAddress`, email address, used by the system to send notifications
  to the users and also used by others optionnals schemas

* `EProperty`, used to configure the application
* `EPermission`, used to configure the security of the application

* `Card`, generic documenting card
* `Bookmark`, an entity type used to allow a user to customize his links within
  the application

Cubes available
```````````````

An application is based on several basic cubes. In the set of available
basic cubes we can find for example :

* addressbook_: PhoneNumber and PostalAddress

* basket_: Basket (like a shopping cart)

* blog_: Blog (a *very* basic blog)

* comment_: Comment (to attach comment threads to entities)

* email_: archiving management for emails (`Email`, `Emailpart`,
  `Emailthread`)

* event_: Event (define events, display them in calendars)

* file_: File (to allow users to upload and store binary or text files)

* folder_: Folder (to organize things but grouping them in folders)

* keyword_: Keyword (to define classification schemes)

* link_: Link (to collect links to web resources)

* mailinglist_: MailingList (to reference a mailing-list and the URLs
  for its archives and its admin interface)

* person_: Person (easily mixed with addressbook)

* tag_: Tag (to tag anything)

* task_: Task (something to be done between start and stop date)

* zone_: Zone (to define places within larger places, for example a
  city in a state in a country)

To declare the use of a component, once installed, add the name of the component
to the variable `__use__` in the file `__pkginfo__.py` of your own component.

  The listed cubes above are available as debian-packages on `CubicWeb's forge`_.
