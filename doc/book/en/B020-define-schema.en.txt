Data model definition (*schema*)
================================

The schema is the core piece of a `CubicWeb` application as it defines
the data model handled. It is based on entities types already defined
in the `CubicWeb` standard library and others, more specific, we would 
expect to find in one or more Python files under the `schema` directory.

At this point, it is important to make clear the difference between
relation type and relation definition: a relation type is only a relation
name with potentially other additionnal properties (see XXXX), whereas a 
relation definition is a complete triplet 
"<subject entity type> <relation type> <object entity type>". 
A relation type could have been implied if none is related to a 
relation definition of the schema.
