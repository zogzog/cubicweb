CSS changes
===========

XXX FIXME explain CSS used by cubciweb

We cannot modify the order in which the application is reading the CSS. In
the case we want to create new CSS style, the best is to define it a in a new
CSS located under ``myapp/data/`` and use those new styles while writing
customized views and templates.

If you want to modify an existing CSS styling property, you will have to use
``!important`` declaration to override the existing property. The application
apply a higher priority on the default CSS and you can not change that. 
Customized CSS will not be read first.
