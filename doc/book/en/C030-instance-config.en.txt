Configure an instance
=====================

While creating an instance, a configuration file is generated in::

    $ (CW_REGISTRY) / <instance> / <configuration name>.conf

For example::

    /etc/cubicweb.d/JPL/all-in-one.conf

It is a simple text file format INI. In the following description,
each option name is prefixed with its own section and followed by its
default value if necessarry, e.g. "`<section>.<option>` [value]."


Configuring the Web server
--------------------------
:`web.auth-model` [cookie]:
    authentication mode, cookie or http
:`web.realm`:
    realm of the application in http authentication mode
:`web.http-session-time` [0]:
    period of inactivity of an HTTP session before it closes automatically.
    Duration in seconds, 0 meaning no expiration (or more exactly at the
    closing of the browser client)

:`main.anonymous-user`, `main.anonymous-password`:
    login and password to use to connect to the RQL server with
    HTTP anonymous connection. EUser account should exist.

:`main.base-url`:
    url base site to be used to generate the urls of web pages

Https configuration
```````````````````
It is possible to make a site accessible for anonymous http connections
and https for authenticated users. This requires to
use apache (by example) for redirection and the variable `main.https-url`
of configuration file.

:Example:

   For an apache redirection of a site accessible via `http://localhost/demo`
   and `https://localhost/demo` and actually running on port 8080, it
   takes to the http:::

     RewriteCond %(REQUEST_URI) ^/demo
     RewriteRule ^/demo$/demo/
     RewriteRule ^/demo/(.*) http://127.0.0.1:8080/$1 [L,P]
  
   and for the https:::

     RewriteCond %(REQUEST_URI) ^/ demo
     RewriteRule ^/demo$/demo/
     RewriteRule ^/demo/(.*) http://127.0.0.1:8080/https/$1 [L,P]


   and we will file in the all-in-one.conf of the instance:::

     base-url = http://localhost/demo
     https-url = `https://localhost/demo`
