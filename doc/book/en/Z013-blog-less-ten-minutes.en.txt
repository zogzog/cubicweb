Have a blog ready in less than ten minutes!
-------------------------------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to install the following packages::

    cubicweb, cubicweb-blog

The package `cubicweb` is installing the command `cubicweb-ctl` that
will allow you to create new application.

The package `cubicweb-blog` is installing the blogging support for the
`CubicWeb` framework.

Application creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creation and initialization of your application by running::
    
    cubicweb-ctl create blog myblog

*myblog* is the name of the application you are creating.

*blog* is the name of the component on which your application
is based. 

Application launch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application is now ready to go::

    cubicweb-ctl start -D myblog

This is it. Your blog is ready to you. Go to http://localhost:8080 and enjoy!!


A little code snapshot from behind the scene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The component `blog`, referred as a `cube` in the book 
(see :ref:`TermsVocabulary` for a complete definition), defines
a data model in ``/usr/share/cubicweb/cubes/blog/schema.py``. 
Here is the corresponding Python code::

    from cubicweb.schema import format_constraint

    class Blog(EntityType):
        title = String(maxsize=50, required=True)
        description_format = String(meta=True, internationalizable=True, maxsize=50,
                                    default='text/rest', constraints=[format_constraint])
        description = String()
        rss_url = String(maxsize=128, description=_('blog\'s rss url (useful for when using external site such as feedburner)'))


    class BlogEntry(EntityType):
        title = String(required=True, fulltextindexed=True, maxsize=256)
        content_format = String(meta=True, internationalizable=True, maxsize=50,
                                default='text/rest', constraints=[format_constraint])
        content = String(required=True, fulltextindexed=True)
        entry_of = SubjectRelation('Blog', cardinality='?*')

Two types of entities are defined here: Blog and BlogEntry.

A Blog is defined by a title, a description and its format and a
RSS URL to provide RSS feed.

A BlogEntry is defined by a title, a content and its format and
a relation to a Blog, meaning a BlogEntry belongs to a Blog.


Next step
~~~~~~~~~

This was a brief demonstration of the re-usability of cubes and a way
to show how you can use `CubicWeb` straigth out of the box.

As a developper, you'll want to know more about how to develop new
cubes and cutomize the views and this is what we talk about now.
