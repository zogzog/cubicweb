Configure an instance
=====================

While creating an instance, a configuration file is generated in::

    $ (CW_INSTANCES_DIR) / <instance> / <configuration name>.conf

For example::

    /etc/cubicweb.d/myblog/all-in-one.conf

It is a simple text file in the INI format
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file). In the following description,
each option name is prefixed with its own section and followed by its
default value if necessary, e.g. "`<section>.<option>` [value]."

.. _`WebServerConfig`:

Configuring the Web server
--------------------------
:`web.auth-model` [cookie]:
    authentication mode, cookie or http
:`web.realm`:
    realm of the instance in http authentication mode
:`web.http-session-time` [0]:
    period of inactivity of an HTTP session before it closes automatically.
    Duration in seconds, 0 meaning no expiration (or more exactly at the
    closing of the browser client)

:`main.anonymous-user`, `main.anonymous-password`:
    login and password to use to connect to the RQL server with
    HTTP anonymous connection. CWUser account should exist.

:`main.base-url`:
    url base site to be used to generate the urls of web pages

Https configuration
```````````````````
It is possible to make a site accessible for anonymous http connections
and https for authenticated users. This requires to
use apache (for example) for redirection and the variable `main.https-url`
of configuration file.

For this to work you have to activate the following apache modules :

* rewrite
* proxy
* http_proxy

The command on Debian based systems for that is ::

  a2enmod rewrite http_proxy proxy
  /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

:Example:

   For an apache redirection of a site accessible via `http://localhost/demo`
   and `https://localhost/demo` and actually running on port 8080, it
   takes to the http:::

     ProxyPreserveHost On
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/demo
     RewriteRule ^/demo$ /demo/
     RewriteRule ^/demo/(.*) http://127.0.0.1:8080/$1 [L,P]

   and for the https:::

     ProxyPreserveHost On
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/ demo
     RewriteRule ^/demo$/demo/
     RewriteRule ^/demo/(.*) http://127.0.0.1:8080/https/$1 [L,P]


   and we will file in the all-in-one.conf of the instance:::

     base-url = http://localhost/demo
     https-url = https://localhost/demo

Notice that if you simply want a site accessible through https, not *both* http
and https, simply set `base-url` to the https url and the first section into your
apache configuration (as you would have to do for an http configuration with an
apache front-end).

Setting up the web client
-------------------------
:`web.embed-allowed`:
    regular expression matching sites which could be "embedded" in
    the site (controllers 'embed')
:`web.submit-url`:
    url where the bugs encountered in the instance can be mailed to


RQL server configuration
------------------------
:`main.host`:
    host name if it can not be detected correctly
:`main.pid-file`:
    file where will be written the server pid
:`main.uid`:
    user account to use for launching the server when it is
    root launched by init
:`main.session-time [30*60]`:
    timeout of a RQL session
:`main.query-log-file`:
    file where all requests RQL executed by the server are written


Pyro configuration for the instance
-----------------------------------
Web server side:

:`pyro.pyro-instance-id`:
    pyro identifier of RQL server (e.g. the instance name)

RQL server side:

:`main.pyro-server`:
    boolean to switch on/off pyro server-side

:`pyro.pyro-host`:
    pyro host:port number. If no port is specified, it is assigned
    automatically.

RQL and web servers side:

:`pyro.pyro-ns-host`:
    hostname hosting pyro server name. If no value is
    specified, it is located by a request from broadcast

:`pyro.pyro-ns-group`:
    pyro group in which to save the instance (will default to 'cubicweb')


Configuring e-mail
------------------
RQL and web server side:

:`email.mangle-mails [no]`:
    indicates whether the email addresses must be displayed as is or
    transformed

RQL server side:

:`email.smtp-host [mail]`:
    hostname hosting the SMTP server to use for outgoing mail
:`email.smtp-port [25]`:
    SMTP server port to use for outgoing mail
:`email.sender-name`:
    name to use for outgoing mail of the instance
:`email.sender-addr`:
    address for outgoing mail of the instance
:`email.default dest-addrs`:
    destination addresses by default, if used by the configuration of the
    dissemination of the model (separated by commas)
:`email.supervising-addrs`:
    destination addresses of e-mails of supervision (separated by

-------------------
:`main.log-threshold`:
    level of filtering messages (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
:`main.log-file`:
    file to write messages


.. _PersistentProperties:

Configuring persistent properties
---------------------------------
Other configuration settings are in the form of entities `CWProperty`
in the database. It must be edited via the web interface or by
RQL queries.

:`ui.encoding`:
    Character encoding to use for the web
:`navigation.short-line-size`:
    number of characters for "short" display
:`navigation.page-size`:
    maximum number of entities to show per results page
:`navigation.related-limit`:
    number of related entities to show up on primary entity view
:`navigation.combobox-limit`:
    number of entities unrelated to show up on the drop-down lists of
