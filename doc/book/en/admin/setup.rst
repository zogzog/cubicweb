.. _SetUpEnv:

Installation of a *CubicWeb* environment
========================================

Official releases are available from the `CubicWeb.org forge`_ and from
`PyPI`_. Since CubicWeb is developed using `Agile software development
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development>`_ techniques, releases
happen frequently. In a version numbered X.Y.Z, X changes after a few years when
the API breaks, Y changes after a few weeks when features are added and Z
changes after a few days when bugs are fixed.

Depending on your needs, you will chose a different way to install CubicWeb on
your system:

- `Installation on Debian/Ubuntu`_
- `Installation on Windows`_
- `Installation in a virtualenv`_
- `Installation with pip`_
- `Installation with easy_install`_
- `Installation from tarball`_

If you are a power-user and need the very latest features, you will

- `Install from version control`_

Once the software is installed, move on to :ref:`ConfigEnv` for better control
and advanced features of |cubicweb|.

.. _`Installation on Windows`: WindowsInstallation_
.. _`Installation in a virtualenv`: VirtualenvInstallation_
.. _`Installation with pip`: PipInstallation_

.. _`Installation from tarball`: TarballInstallation_
.. _`Install from version control`: MercurialInstallation_


.. _DebianInstallation:

Debian/Ubuntu install
---------------------

|cubicweb| is packaged for Debian/Ubuntu (and derived
distributions). Their integrated package-management system make
installation and upgrade much easier for users since
dependencies (like databases) are automatically installed.

Depending on the distribution you are using, add the appropriate line to your
`list of sources` (for example by editing ``/etc/apt/sources.list``).

For Debian 7.0 Wheezy (stable)::

  deb http://download.logilab.org/production/ wheezy/

For Debian Sid (unstable)::

  deb http://download.logilab.org/production/ sid/

For Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin (Long Term Support) and newer::

  deb http://download.logilab.org/production/ precise/

The repositories are signed with the `Logilab's gnupg key`_. You can download
and register the key to avoid warnings::

  wget -q http://download.logilab.org/logilab-dists-key.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -

Update your list of packages and perform the installation::

  apt-get update
  apt-get install cubicweb cubicweb-dev

``cubicweb`` installs the framework itself, allowing you to create new
instances. ``cubicweb-dev`` installs the development environment
allowing you to develop new cubes.

There is also a wide variety of :ref:`cubes <AvailableCubes>`. You can access a
list of available cubes using ``apt-cache search cubicweb`` or at the
`CubicWeb.org forge`_.

.. note::

  `cubicweb-dev` will install basic sqlite support. You can easily setup
  :ref:`cubicweb with other database <DatabaseInstallation>` using the following
  virtual packages :

  * `cubicweb-postgresql-support` contains the necessary dependencies for
    using :ref:`cubicweb with postgresql datatabase <PostgresqlConfiguration>`

  * `cubicweb-mysql-support` contains the necessary dependencies for using
    :ref:`cubicweb with mysql database <MySqlConfiguration>`.

.. _`Logilab's gnupg key`: http://download.logilab.org/logilab-dists-key.asc
.. _`CubicWeb.org Forge`: http://www.cubicweb.org/project/

.. _WindowsInstallation:

Windows Install
---------------

You need to have `python`_ version >= 2.5 and < 3 installed.

If you want an automated install, your best option is probably the
:ref:`EasyInstallInstallation`. EasyInstall is a tool that helps users to
install python packages along with their dependencies, searching for suitable
pre-compiled binaries on the `The Python Package Index`_.

If you want better control over the process as well as a suitable development
environment or if you are having problems with `easy_install`, read on to
:ref:`SetUpWindowsEnv`.

.. _python:  http://www.python.org/
.. _`The Python Package Index`: http://pypi.python.org

.. _VirtualenvInstallation:

`Virtualenv` install
--------------------

|cubicweb| can be safely installed, used and contained inside a
`virtualenv`_. You can use either :ref:`pip <PipInstallation>` or
:ref:`easy_install <EasyInstallInstallation>` to install |cubicweb|
inside an activated virtual environment.

.. _PipInstallation:

`pip` install
-------------

`pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ is a python tool that helps downloading,
building, installing, and managing Python packages and their dependencies. It
is fully compatible with `virtualenv`_ and installs the packages from sources
published on the `The Python Package Index`_.

.. _`virtualenv`: http://virtualenv.openplans.org/

A working compilation chain is needed to build the modules that include C
extensions. If you really do not want to compile anything, installing `Lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_,
`Twisted Web <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads/>`_ and `libgecode
<http://www.gecode.org/>`_ will help.

For Debian, these minimal dependencies can be obtained by doing::

  apt-get install gcc python-pip python-dev python-lxml

or, if you prefer to get as much as possible from pip::

  apt-get install gcc python-pip python-dev libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev

For Windows, you can install pre-built packages (possible `source
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_). For a minimal setup, install
`pip <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pip>`_, `setuptools
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#setuptools>`_, `libxml-python
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#libxml-python>`_, `lxml
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml>`_ and `twisted
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#twisted>`_ from this source making
sure to choose the correct architecture and version of Python.

Finally, install |cubicweb| and its dependencies, by running::

  pip install cubicweb

Many other :ref:`cubes <AvailableCubes>` are available. A list is available at
`PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=cubicweb&submit=search>`_
or at the `CubicWeb.org forge`_.

For example, installing the *blog cube* is achieved by::

  pip install cubicweb-blog

.. _EasyInstallInstallation:

`easy_install` install
----------------------

.. note::

   If you are not a Windows user and you have a compilation environment, we
   recommend you to use the PipInstallation_.

`easy_install`_ is a python utility that helps downloading, installing, and
managing python packages and their dependencies.

Install |cubicweb| and its dependencies, run::

  easy_install cubicweb

There is also a wide variety of :ref:`cubes <AvailableCubes>`. You can access a
list of available cubes on `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=cubicweb&submit=search>`_
or at the `CubicWeb.org Forge`_.

For example, installing the *blog cube* is achieved by::

  easy_install cubicweb-blog

.. note::

  If you encounter problem with :ref:`cubes <AvailableCubes>` installation,
  consider using :ref:`PipInstallation` which is more stable
  but can not installed pre-compiled binaries.

.. _`easy_install`: http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html


.. _SourceInstallation:

Install from source
-------------------

.. _TarballInstallation:

You can download the archive containing the sources from
`http://download.logilab.org/pub/cubicweb/ <http://download.logilab.org/pub/cubicweb/>`_.

Make sure you also have all the :ref:`InstallDependencies`.

Once uncompressed, you can install the framework from inside the uncompressed
folder with::

  python setup.py install

Or you can run |cubicweb| directly from the source directory by
setting the :ref:`resource mode <RessourcesConfiguration>` to `user`. This will
ease the development with the framework.

There is also a wide variety of :ref:`cubes <AvailableCubes>`. You can access a
list of availble cubes at the `CubicWeb.org Forge`_.


.. _MercurialInstallation:

Install from version control system
-----------------------------------

To keep-up with on-going development, clone the :ref:`Mercurial
<MercurialPresentation>` repository::

  hg clone -u stable http://hg.logilab.org/cubicweb # stable branch
  hg clone http://hg.logilab.org/cubicweb # development branch

To get many of CubicWeb's dependencies and a nice set of base cubes, run the
`clone_deps.py` script located in `cubicweb/bin/`::

  python cubicweb/bin/clone_deps.py

(Windows users should replace slashes with antislashes).

This script will clone a set of mercurial repositories into the
directory containing the ``cubicweb`` repository, and update them to the
latest published version tag (if any).

.. note::

  In every cloned repositories, a `hg tags` will display a list of
  tags in reverse chronological order. One reasonnable option is to go to a
  tagged version: the latest published version or example, as done by
  the `clone_deps` script)::

   hg update cubicweb-version-3.12.2

Make sure you also have all the :ref:`InstallDependencies`.
