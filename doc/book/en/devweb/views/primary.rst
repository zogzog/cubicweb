.. _primary_view:

The Primary View
-----------------

By default, *CubicWeb* provides a view that fits every available
entity type. This is the first view you might be interested in
modifying. It is also one of the richest and most complex.

It is automatically selected on a one line result set containing an
entity.

It lives in the :mod:`cubicweb.web.views.primary` module.
