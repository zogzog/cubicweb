`CubicWeb` - The Semantic Web is a construction game!
=====================================================

`CubicWeb` is a semantic web application framework, licensed under the LGPL,
that empowers developers to efficiently build web applications by reusing
components (called `cubes`) and following the well known object-oriented design
principles.

Its main features are:

* an engine driven by the explicit :ref:`data model <DefineDataModel>` of the application, 
* a query language name :ref:`RQL <RQL>` similar to W3C's SPARQL, 
* a :ref:`selection+view <DefineViews>` mechanism for semi-automatic XHTML/XML/JSON/text generation, 
* a library of reusable :ref:`components <cubes>` (data model and views) that fulfill common needs,
* the power and flexibility of the Python_ programming language,
* the reliability of SQL databases, LDAP directories, Subversion and Mercurial for storage backends.

Built since 2000 from an R&D effort still continued, supporting 100,000s of
daily visits at some production sites, `CubicWeb` is a proven end to end solution
for semantic web application development that promotes quality, reusability and
efficiency.

The unbeliever will read the :ref:`Tutorial`.

The hacker will join development at the forge_.

The impatient will go strait away to :ref:`QuickInstall`.

The impatient developper will move right away to :ref:`SetUpEnv`.
