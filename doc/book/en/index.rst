*CubicWeb* - The Semantic Web is a construction game!
=====================================================

*CubicWeb* is a semantic web application framework, licensed under the LGPL,
that empowers developers to efficiently build web applications by reusing
components (called `cubes`) and following the well known object-oriented design
principles.

Its main features are:

* an engine driven by the explicit :ref:`data model <DefineDataModel>` of the application,
* a query language named :ref:`RQL <RQL>` similar to W3C's SPARQL,
* a :ref:`selection+view <DefineViews>` mechanism for semi-automatic XHTML/XML/JSON/text generation,
* a library of reusable :ref:`components <cubes>` (data model and views) that fulfill common needs,
* the power and flexibility of the Python_ programming language,
* the reliability of SQL databases, LDAP directories, Subversion and Mercurial for storage backends.

Built since 2000 from an R&D effort still continued, supporting 100,000s of
daily visits at some production sites, *CubicWeb* is a proven end to end solution
for semantic web application development that promotes quality, reusability and
efficiency.

The unbeliever will read the :ref:`Tutorial`.

The hacker will join development at the forge_.

The impatient developer will move right away to :ref:`SetUpEnv`.

The chatter lover will join the `jabber forum`_, the `mailing-list`_ and the blog_.
