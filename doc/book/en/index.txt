`CubicWeb` - The Semantic Web is a construction game!
=====================================================

`CubicWeb` is a semantic web application framework that empowers developers
to efficiently build web applications by reusing components (called `cubes`)
and following the well known object-oriented design principles.

Its main features:

* an engine driven by the explicit data model of the application, 
* a query language similar to W3C's SPARQL, 
* a selection+view mechanism for semi-automatic XHTML/XML/JSON/text generation, 
* a library of reusable components (data model and views) that fulfill common needs,
* the power and flexibility of the Python programming language,

make `CubicWeb` a mature end to end solution for web 
application development that promotes quality, reusability and 
efficiency.

The unbeliever will read the :ref:`Overview`.

The impatient will move right away to :ref:`MiseEnPlaceEnv`.
