`CubicWeb` Foundations
======================

A little history...
-------------------

`CubicWeb` is a web application framework developped by Logilab_ since 2001.

Entirely written in Python, `CubicWeb` publishes data from all sorts
of sources such as SQL database, LDAP directory and versioning system such
as subversion.

`CubicWeb` user interface was designed to let the final user a huge flexibility
on how to select and how to display content. It allows to browse the knowledge
database and to display the results with the best rendering according to
the context.
This interface flexibility gives back the user the control of the 
rendering parameters that are usually reserved for developpers.


We can list a couple of web applications developped with `CubicWeb`, an online
public phone directory (see http://www.118000.fr/), a system for managing 
digital studies and simulations for a research lab, a tool for shared children
babysitting (see http://garde-partagee.atoukontact.fr/), a tool to manage
software developpment (see http://www.logilab.org), an application for
managing museums collections (see 
http://collections.musees-haute-normandie.fr/collections/), etc.

In 2008, `CubicWeb` was ported for a new type of source : the datastore 
from `GoogleAppEngine`_.
