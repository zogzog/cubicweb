3.34 (UNRELEASED)
=================

New features
------------

* Various bits of a CubicWeb application configuration can be now be
  overridden through environments variables matching configuration option
  names prefixed by ``CW_`` (for instance ``CW_BASE_URL``).

* Cubes are now standard Python packages named as ``cubicweb_<cubename>``.
  They are not anymore installed in ``<prefix>/share/cubicweb/cubes``. Their
  discovery by CubicWeb is handled by a new setuptools entry point
  ``cubicweb.cubes``. A backward compatibility layer is kept for "legacy"
  cubes.
