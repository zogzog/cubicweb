3.25 (UNRELEASED)
=================

New features
------------

* A new option `connections-pooler-enabled` (default yes) has been added. This
  allow to switch off internal connection pooling for use with others poolers
  such as pgbouncer_.

.. _pgbouncer: https://pgbouncer.github.io/

* In `deleteconf` view (confirmation before deletion), the list of first-level
  composite objects that would be deleted along with the primary entity is
  displayed (01eeea97e549).

* The ``cubicweb.pyramid`` module now provides a Paste application factory
  registered as an entry point named ``pyramid_main`` and that can be used to
  run a Pyramid WSGI application bound to a CubicWeb repository.

* A new configuration type ``pyramid`` has been added to create CubicWeb's
  instances (through ``cubicweb-ctl create -c pyramid <basecube> <appid>``).
  This configuration bootstraps a CubicWeb instance that is essentially a
  repository plus the minimal setup to run a Pyramid WSGI application on top
  of it. Noticeably, it does not ship all *web* configuration but rather
  relies on configuration declared in a ``development.ini`` file for any
  Pyramid application.

* A new way to declare workflows as simple data structure (dict/list) has been
  introduced. Respective utility functions live in ``cubicweb.wfutils``
  module. This handles both the creation and migration of workflows.

* A new IDublinCore adapter has been introduced to control the generation of
  Dublin Core metadata that are used in several base views.

* It is now possible to *derive* rtags using their ``derive`` method
  (0849a5eb57b8).

* A new ``cubicweb-ctl scheduler <appid>`` command has been introduced to run
  background and periodic tasks of the repository (previously called *looping
  tasks*). In a production environment, a process with this command should be
  run alongside with a WSGI server process (possibly running multiple
  processes itself).


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* As a consequence of the replacement of the old looping tasks manager by a
  scheduler, all cubicweb-ctl's "start" commands (i.e. ``start``, ``pyramid``,
  ``wsgi``) do not start repository *looping tasks manager* anymore, nor do
  they start the scheduler. Site administrators are thus expected to start
  this scheduler as a separate process.


API changes
-----------

* In ``cubicweb.pyramid``, function ``make_cubicweb_application`` got renamed
  into ``config_from_cwconfig`` (950ce7d9f642).

* Several cleanups in repository's session management have been conducted
  resulting from changes introduced in 3.19 release.


Removals
--------

* Support for 'https-url' configuration option has been removed
  (4516c3956d46).

* The `next_tabindex` method of request class has been removed (011730a4af73).
