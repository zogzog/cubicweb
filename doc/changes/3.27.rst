3.27 (not yet released)
=======================

New features
------------

* Tests can now be run concurrently across multiple processes. You can use
  `pytest-xdist`_ for that. For tests using `PostgresApptestConfiguration` you
  should be aware that `startpgcluster()` can't run concurrently. Workaround is
  to call pytest with ``--dist=loadfile`` to use a single test process per test
  module or use an existing database cluster and set ``db-host`` and
  ``db-port`` of ``devtools.DEFAULT_PSQL_SOURCES['system']`` accordingly.

.. _pytest-xdist: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* ``cubicweb-ctl`` commands "start", "stop", "restart", "reload" and "status"
  have been removed because they relied on the Twisted web server backend that
  is no longer maintained nor working with Python 3.

Deprecated code drops
---------------------

Most code deprecated until version 3.25 has been dropped.
