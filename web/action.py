"""abstract action classes for CubicWeb web client

Actions are typically displayed in an action box, but can also be used
in other parts of the interface (the user menu, the footer, etc.). The
'order', 'category' and 'title' class attributes control how the action will
be displayed. The 'submenu' attribute is only used for actions in the
action box.

The most important method from a developper point of view in the
:meth:'Action.url' method, which returns a URL on which the navigation
should be directed to perform the action.  The common way of
writing that method is to simply return a URL to the current rset with a
special view (with `self._cw.build_url(...)` for instance) 

Many examples are available in :mod:`cubicweb.web.views.actions`.
