About this site
===============

This web application is based on the CubicWeb knowledge management system
from Logilab_. CubicWeb is made of an object database and a web
framework. It allows to develop an application by defining a set of
entities and their relationships, plus a set of views that present the
data selected from the object database using a specific query language.

This application has a precise schema_ and can be considered an
example of a semantic web database, as it can export the data to XML
and others formats and is not limited to publishing HTML.
